+ This is an example solver for 2D steady state heat conduction problem using FVM

+ In software development it is often useful to start with a quick-and-dirty solution to a problem before going into the details.
This helps to find out if the idea works as soon as possible and also gives confidence for the implementation. It is easier to work on
code that already does something

If you are new to FVM solvers or to solvers in general, this example might give you a good starting point to learn and experiment with algorithms.
